# 💖 Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot (Multi-language AI Personality)

This project is a fun and emotionally engaging **AI-powered chatbot** that behaves like a loving, caring, dramatic, and slightly moody **virtual girlfriend**. It is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and integrates **Google Gemini API** to power natural, multi-language conversations.

---

## 🌟 Concept

This chatbot is trained to behave like an Indian girlfriend, who:

- Speaks in the **language the user uses** — Marathi, Hindi, or English
- Responds using respectful words like _"tumhi"_ when talking to her boyfriend (you!)
- Has a clingy, loving, caring, and jealous personality 😤
- Is playful, emotional, loyal, and totally in love with _you_, Baby 💕

The goal is to simulate a **realistic emotional connection** with a characterful chatbot that talks, reacts, and expresses love the way a dramatic, expressive desi girlfriend would.
